## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1
- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):**  
  𝛽₁ = 0  
  The number of playlists a song is in (predictor variable) and the number of streams (response variable) have no linear relationship.

- **Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):**  
  𝛽₁ ≠ 0  
  The number of playlists a song is in (predictor variable) and the number of streams (response variable) have some linear relationship.

### Hypothesis 2
- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):**  
  𝛽₁ = 0, 𝛽₂ = 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ = 0  
  None of the variables listed have a statistical impact on the number of streams.

- **Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):**  
  𝛽₁ ≠ 0, 𝛽₂ ≠ 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ ≠ 0  
  At least one of the variables listed above has a statistical impact on the number of streams.

### Hypothesis 3
- **Null Hypothesis (𝐻₀):**  
  𝛽₁ = 0, 𝛽₂ = 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ = 0  
  None of the months are statistically significant to impact the number of streams.

  

- **Alternate Hypothesis (𝐻ₐ):**  
  𝛽₁ ≠ 0, 𝛽₂ ≠ 0, ..., 𝛽ₚ ≠ 0  
  At least one of the months is statistically significant to impact the number of streams.
